# MuseSnap
Music App

Note-Go to master branch for source code.

Hello Welcome to my personal project demonstration called as MuseSnap.
While scrolling on insta or youtube , you might get to see lots of Musicians ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽºðŸŽµðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ§
But sometimes we fail to recognize them and find the exact type of music they create.

I have the solution to this:
Introducing MuseSnap. ðŸš€

You just take the screenshot of that musician and upload the image here.
The AI will recognize the face and help you identify the musician and provide you with their dedicated playlist.
Playlist will be created depending on the mood of the listener ,
AND you can just by simple click direclty download the playlist in your personal google drive or your personal device.

Here is the demonstration of MuseSnap:

Work done: Created a image uploader using spring boot and mongodb, use POSTMAN to store the images - <b>GO TO MASTER BRANCH</b> for source code - the images are directly getting stored in the database. Future Plan- Use AWS S3 for better use.
