# Muse Snap ðŸŽµðŸ“·

Muse Snap is an innovative web application designed to make music discovery seamless and fun. Scrolling insta or Youtube , cannot find that drummer or artist anywhere else , upload an image of a musician, let our backend AI recognize the artist, and generate playlists based on trending songs. Whether youâ€™re curating moods or just exploring new music, Muse Snap is your gateway to discovering the tunes that inspire the world.

## Features

### 1. **Image Uploading**
   - Users can upload images or screenshots of musicians via the web interface.
   - Backend API (`/api/imagga/recognize`) processes these images to analyze and identify the musician.
   - AI functionality is integrated but currently operational **only on the backend**.

### 2. **Image Analysis**
   - **Imagga API** is used to process the uploaded images for identifying the artist.
   - Use Postman or similar tools to test this feature via the backend API.

### 3. **Playlist Generation**
   - Once the artist's name is identified (manual input for now), the **Deezer API** fetches a playlist of their trending songs.
   - Users can explore mood-based, categorized playlists.

## Use Case: **Kestra Workflow Integration**
We used **Kestra** as a workflow orchestration tool in this project. 

- A custom workflow YAML file has been added, which triggers specific actions when a user uploads an image of a musician.
- The workflow automates the process of fetching uploaded images stored in **MongoDB**, downloading them, and analyzing them for artist recognition.
- This integration simplifies task management and enhances the scalability of the system.

## Tools and Technologies

### **Frontend**
- **React** + **Vite** for a fast and efficient development environment.
- **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive UI design.

### **Backend**
- **Spring Boot** to power the backend, ensuring robust API handling and integrations.
- **MongoDB** for cloud-based database storage and management via **MongoDB Atlas**.

### **AI and APIs**
- **ChatGPT** for auto-generating and optimizing code for image upload functionality.
- **Imagga API** for recognizing and analyzing uploaded musician images.
- **Deezer API** for generating artist-based playlists.

## How to Run the Project
 - For smooth running install Intellij iDE , and run the project, you can run the image  recognition part in backend , while
 - for front end use VS Code. Just select any image from your local device , upload it , then click on generate playlist , where you can add artist name, the API will help you generate playlist of their songs.
### **Backend Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/musesnap.git
   cd musesnap/backend
   ```
2. Open the backend folder in IntelliJ IDEA.

   Set up the required environment variables in the application.properties or application.yml file (e.g., MongoDB URI).

   - Run the backend:
   - Locate the main class (e.g., com.musesnap.MuseSnapApplication) and run it.
   - Ensure the backend is running at http://localhost:8080.
   - Test the backend: Use Postman or any API testing tool. API endpoint example: POST /api/upload-image to upload an image

### **Frontend Setup**
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd musesnap/frontend
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Access the frontend: Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173 (default Vite development port).

5. Future Enhancements
   - Add support for more complex image recognition.
   - Enhance the music playlist recommendations.
   - Allow direct downloading of playlists to Google Drive or the user's device.
