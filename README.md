## Features

### 1. **Image Uploading**
   - Users can upload images or screenshots of musicians via the web interface.
   - Backend API (`/api/imagga/recognize`) processes these images to analyze and identify the musician.
   - AI functionality is integrated but currently operational **only on the backend**.

### 2. **Image Analysis**
   - **Imagga API** is used to process the uploaded images for identifying the artist.
   - Use Postman or similar tools to test this feature via the backend API.

### 3. **Playlist Generation**
   - Once the artist's name is identified (manual input for now), the **Deezer API** fetches a playlist of their trending songs.
   - Users can explore mood-based, categorized playlists.

## Use Case: **Kestra Workflow Integration**
We used **Kestra** as a workflow orchestration tool in this project:
- It helps in automating backend tasks such as triggering API calls for image analysis and playlist generation.
- This allows seamless task orchestration, ensuring efficiency and scalability.
